## Nature is as connected as IoT
The interest in local gardening has signifcantly risen after Covid-19. Recent surveys show that 80% of the European population are willing to privately contribute to conserve natural habitats. In addition, the new EU Biodiversity Strategy has been just announced aiming to put Europe’s biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030. With over 150 million gardens in Europe, covering an area larger than all our national nature reserves put together, what we choose to do with our gardens really does matter for nature and climate.

## Biodiversity is measurable, but how?
In nature, everything’s interconnected – without trees, there are no flowers, without flowers, there are no insects, without insects, there are no birds. It is precisely this variation that’s important to keep everything in balance. Private gardens work exactly the same way – the more variety, the better. Garden designs, certainly within the urban environment, are crucial for biodiversity.
Recent research in ecological acoustics shows that the soundscape monitors very well the biodiversity of the underlying ecological system allowing to draw statistical inference how individual events impact each other.
 
What we are missing are effective possibilities to monitor the progresses we make in improving the local biodiversity, pollution and environmental health. Having possiblities to account for ecological improvements, we can offer incentives to compensate private efforts into preserving local natural habitats and improving quality of life in urban districts.

## Our solution
We are working on developing an IoT node that enables to monitor and improve the local biodiversity over time. The node runs standalone on solar power and can be placed inside the own garden. It is controllable by a smartphone and provide’s smart analytics to prevent negative effects, as garden pests. By combining the IoT node with a recommender engine, we send notices how seasonal gardening measures can improve the measured biodiversity. We are currently ramping up the project and search for development partners.
